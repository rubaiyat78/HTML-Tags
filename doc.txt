Tag-01: <!--...--> = Defines a comment
=======================================

***You can use the comment tag to "hide" scripts from browsers without support for scripts (so they don't show them as plain text):

<script type="text/javascript">
<!--
function displayMsg() {
  alert("Hello World!")
}
//-->
</script> 

Tag-02: <!DOCTYPE> = Defines the document type
==================================

***All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.

The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.

***The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is NOT case sensitive.

Tag-03: <a> = Defines a hyperlink
===================================

***The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.

The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

***If the <a> tag has no href attribute, it is only a placeholder for a hyperlink.
